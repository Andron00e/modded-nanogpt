## 11/19/24 FlexAttention record


Note: This record was run for 1875 steps, (5.03 minutes) and attained barely below 3.28 loss.

However, @leloykun discovered that it only attains below 3.28 around half the time. So it's not quite clear that this is valid.

As a result, in the main branch, I have increased the step count by +30, which would make the training 5.1 minutes.
